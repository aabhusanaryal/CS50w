# Project 0 - Search
#### by Aabhusan Aryal

This is my Project 0 for CS50w. It is a frontend clone for Google. You can type in your query, and when you click on search, you'll be redirected to Google search result page for that query.

### Features:
1. Normal Google search.
2. "I'm Feeling Lucky" button that directly takes you to the first result for the given query; without shouwing the results page.
3. Image search.
4. Advance Search
